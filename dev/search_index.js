SimpleCrystals implements all 3D and 2D Bravais lattices (e.g. FCC & BCC) and allows users to define a custom basis to create polyatomic Bravais lattices or to create non-Bravais crystal structures. The AtomsBase interface is implemented to make use with other Julian molecular simulation software simple. There is no support for reading in crystal structures from other software (e.g. CIF files). Check out Xtals.jl or AtomsIO.jl for that. SimpleCrystals is intended to provide a quick, lightweight method for generating atomic coordinates without leaving Julia.","category":"page"},{"location":"#Monoatomic-Bravais-Lattices:","page":"Home","title":"Monoatomic Bravais Lattices:","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"","page":"Home","title":"Home","text":"Whenever possible crystals are implemented using a conventional unit cell so that patterning a simulation cell is simple.
